# BFS-DFS_Route_Finder
This program is used to analyse the routes taken from source to destination by the two Algorithms-Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.
</br>
This program reads the matrix from the input file and finds the routes from source to destination using BFS & DFS and writes the path to the Output files-outbfs & outdfs.
This program also uses sparse matrix to store the constraints in the path.
